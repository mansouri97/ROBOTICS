I'm allaying for financial aid for many reasons 
first of all in my country  Tunisia we have not  any payment method yet the government closed paypal , payoner  , payza and all the other payment methods  so there is no way to pay only for cash .
second i'm still student and haven't money  yet  i want to learn the skills to get money in the future  .
so the only way is to apply for the financial aid.

I don't realy have money to afford to join to word universities .

the financial aid will help me to get the certificate to add it to my cv , in tunisia  certificates makes the finding of the job esier and the certificate is from coursera that is the best thing .

finaly i want to say that i don't have the choise because i need the financial aid to improve my skills , to comunicate with others and to get the certificate
